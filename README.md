# Ripple (& XRP)

Note: all $ values are in US dollars.


## Overview and Origin

Ripple Labs is a payment and remittances technology company founded in 2012, first under the name of Opencoin, but later renamed to Ripple Labs in 2015. Founded by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb in light of bitcoins’ intensive energy consumption, they decided to create a more energy efficient blockchain to transfer value. As per Crunchbase, Ripple was firstly funded through multiple seed rounds between 2012-13 which totaled $6.6m. They have then gone on to raise a further $287m over 9 more rounds between 2015-21. Another method of funding the team used and still being used, is selling their native token on the blockchain they created, called XRP. Ripple created the XRP token for one of their cross-border payment products. Ripple Labs decided to keep 55% of the supply (55b/100b tokens), with the ability to sell up to 1 billion XRP a month. In their most recent report, we can see that Q1/2022 total sales of XRP were totaling $273.27m and in Q4/2021 it totaled $717.07m. As we can see just from these two figures alone that the sales of the cryptocurrency XRP to fund Ripple have far exceeded all of the funding rounds combined.









## Business Activities

Ripple is an international payments/settlement network to improve efficiency and certainty. It is mainly designed to increase the processing speed of transactions in cross-border payments. According to Pat White, CEO of Bitwave “Ripple was designed from the very beginning as a replacement for SWIFT (one of the leading cross border payment systems) or to otherwise replace the settlement layer between financial institutions.” A transaction on the Ripple network typically costs 0.00001 XRP, and with the current price of XRP at $0.38, this equates to a transaction fee of just $0.0000038 with settlement occurring in seconds. SWIFT on the other hand, takes around 1-5 working days to settle a transaction and typically costs at least 3-5% of the total value in transaction fees, for small transaction amounts (< $500).

Ripples’ intended customers are financial institutions (FI), mainly banks, who need to do many cross-border payments. SWIFT alone has over 11000 financial institutions using their payment system. According to the US Department of Treasury, SWIFT processed nearly $5t in transactions per business day, therefore totaling around $1.25 quadrillion a year. This goes to show there is a huge market for payment solutions like Ripple.

Ripple uses the power of blockchain to deliver cheap and fast transactions anywhere in the world.
In SWIFT’s circumstance, no money is actually moved from FI to FI rather SWIFT tells one FI to debit their account and the receiving FI to credit their account. This means that FI’s need to have pre-funded accounts in foreign countries with foreign currency. For a smaller FI without foreign accounts this becomes very expensive to transact overseas as they would have to go through several intermediary banks subsequently increasing the transaction fee and time taken to complete the transaction.

The pre-funded foreign accounts are called nostro/vostro accounts, whereby a lot of capital is locked up and idling waiting to be debited or credited. A study in 2015 by McKinsey found that these accounts hold up to $27t in funds. Utilizing the XRP token, Ripple is able to free up these idle funds. XRP is designed to act as a bridge currency between two parties. An example for this could be, that a US bank would simply need to buy XRP in the dollar amount they want to send by utilizing the XRP bridge. The corresponding bank is now able to sell this XRP into their native currency. This eliminates the need for prefunded accounts whilst also making the whole transaction process efficient in terms of speed.




## Landscape


Ripple operates in the cross-border payments and remittances industry, creating a way to send value as efficiently as possible. Payments and remittances have grown rapidly over the past 10 years, due to many technological innovations. The creation and adoption of blockchains has certainly played a role in the innovation of payments as shown in Ripple’s case. Blockchains allow anyone to freely send value anywhere in the world for a fraction of the cost compared to older technologies. As the years progress, blockchain technologies are becoming more accepted and trusted as a means for financial activities. 

Payments and remittances usually require a webpage or app combined with something to access it via a computer, a phone or a tablet. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic (lockdowns and stay-at-home mandates), remittances have rapidly accelerated whereby nearly 1/3rd have all become digital. According to a study conducted by Visa, “there are now more than 1 billion mobile money wallets,” allowing all these people to have instant access to be able to transfer money across the world. This uptick in digital wallets now allows access to these new types of payment solutions at the push of a finger. 

Major companies involved in the payment industry include SWIFT, and also smaller companies such as MoneyGram and Western Union. 



## Results


The business impact has been very limited in Ripple’s case. Although Ripple claims they are working with over 300 financial institutions, this does not compare at all in the slightest to SWIFT which has over 11000 financial institutions. Therefore, in the scope of things Ripple’s impact is only very small in the global aspect. Some of the core metrics used are the number of transactions processed, how much money is transferred, how quickly it is transferred and how cheap it is to transfer. We can see from a technology perspective that Ripple has built a great technology for payments with very low fees and quick transaction times, as stated earlier in the comparison of Ripple and SWIFT.

Some competitors, such as MoneyGram, have actually decided to use Ripple’s solution for some of their cross-border transactions which displays, how promising the technology is, that they have created. Ripple is a privately owned company and therefore, it is very difficult to find many of their business metrics.







## Recommendations


A recommendation for Ripple would be to potentially make a stable coin. These are crypto currencies that are stable (no change in value in terms of $ of the underlying crypto asset). Examples include USDC & USDT which are crypto currencies tied to the value of the US dollar. Over the past few years, we have seen stable coins gain prominence with billions of dollars flowing into them, showing a huge demand for them. As these coins represent a fiat currency of the issuer’s choosing and being presented on the blockchain, this would allow for easy transfer of value around the world in a cheap and quick manner. This would benefit Ripple greatly, as now the institutions would be able to select a stable coin to send to each another, rather than having to transfer through multiple fiat currencies or even having to use XRP at all. This would be using blockchain technology once again, although this would not pose a problem for Ripple, as they have over 10 years of experience developing blockchains and blockchain related technology. At current prices, it costs $1-2 in fees and around 30 seconds to transfer USDC, a popular stable coin on the Ethereum blockchain, from one account to another one. This fee is a fixed fee, no matter what the size of the transfer is. Therefore, as Ripple is targeting mainly financial institutions, whereby large sums are moved per transaction, the fees become almost negligible. The fees can also be reduced more by using alternative blockchains with cheaper fees or potentially using the XRP chain, which has been shown to also have cheap transaction fees. This technology allows the sender to send value anywhere in the world without a single 3rd party involved. Using stable coins would allow for free flow of value around the world, tying in with what Ripple is trying to achieve right now.
